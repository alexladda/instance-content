## Pandemic Airtravel

*April 23th, 2021*

This Dataset comprises 20 years of flights into and out of US territory. This is limited to just domestic US travel. To get the Location Data the destination codes were (inner) joined with their respective locations from [The Global Airport Database](https://www.partow.net/miscellaneous/airportdatabase/index.html).

## NBA stats

*April 12th, 2021*

So apparently refs call fouls in the NBA. This was actually done '*on time*', the upper table is accessed via the data.world API, the second one utilises a pivot of a local copy.

## Dry Beans

*April 9th, 2021*

Fitting for my first try, this topic seems a bit dull. I do like beans, certainly not dry though. I was late to the party anyways.

> Images of 13,611 grains of 7 different registered dry beans were taken with a high-resolution camera. A total of 16 features; 12 dimensions and 4 shape forms, were obtained from the grains.
