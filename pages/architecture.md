# architecture

*This document describes the high-level architecture of this project. If you want to get familiar with it, you are just in the right place!*

**The main purpose** of this project is for me to learn about all aspects of Data Science, Data Analysis and Data Management. This Website is the last element in a modular chain of tools. This site is ever involving with a lot of things being still added constanty. [However there's already a lot to see!](/)

**The idea** is to create a complete pipeline, that will cover all aspects of Data Science. But isn't this an extremely broad and complex interdisciplinary field? Yes, absolutely. The point is not to dive deep into every aspect, but to first achieve a minimal viable ~product~ project. And honestly, [I love complexity](/about/me).

With a complete chain, I can immediately dive into on certain questions. Additionally I will find my way around other environments quickly.

![Diagram of Pipeline with Modules](https://i.imgur.com/zzblUq5.jpg)

* Module 1: Accessing (live) data
* Module 2: Extract, Transform, Load
* Module 3: Storage
* Module 4: Statistics
* Module 5: Representation

### Module 1: Accessing (live) data

*Status: not started*
- [ ] REST APIs
- [ ] GraphQL

First comes the acquisition of data. These tools will fetch data from APIs.

### Module 2: Extract, Transform, Load

*Status: not started*

Next the data will need to be curated to the specific needs.

### Module 3: Storage

*Status: not started*
- [ ] PostgreSQL

Intensely and systematically studying SQL has been first step into this project. Everything before this Module and everything after is either transformed into SQL or from SQL. This growing familiarity to communicate with data is key to data literacy.

### Module 4: Insights

*Status: not started*
- [ ] Statistics
- [ ] Machine Learning
- [ ] AI

This Module will contain the logic to extract meaning and insights from the collected data. This will have the steepest learning curve. Having always been interested in Mathematics, this is my chance to dive deep again. In the last 15 Years I haven't had to use much beyond 11th Grade arithmetics.

### Module 5: Representation

*Status: up and running*
- [x] [flask based blog](https://github.com/alexladda/instance-blog)
- [x] [Tableau](/projects/makeovermonday)
- [ ] decapitate flask, headless JAM stack

The representational layer is what you see here in this Flask based site, specifically in [projects](/projects). Some projects harness the ease and accessibility of Tableau. Others dive into Python's Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib & Seaborn, Plotly.

## Philosophy

1. Focus on Python, SQL, Tableau, git

2. Touch on GCP and AWS technologies

3. Strike a balance in learning best practices and and getting things done.

4. Keep an eye out for opportunities of learning for a broader context.
